# Discord Clone webapp
Hello dear, to this repository a will explane/deploy my _university activity project_, **for this project i used the follow technologies:**

- [X] HTML;
- [X] SCSS (that in the end is CSS);
- [X] Git (to project version control). And;
- [X] GitHub Pages (to deploy the webapp);

## üìö - Purpose of the activity (Project Goal)
Basically a clone of the discord main page was passed as a project/activity and obviously I added responsiveness to work perfectly on any type of screen, be it mobile, television (I think, lol) and several different monitor sizes.

In this project, it was amazing to see the evolution I had in **just 2 weeks studying CSS**, because, as a back-end programmer, I didn't have much contact with these technologies and, in the little contact I had, I did everything wrong and it was always a **DISASTER**!

> Note: From the little contact I had with responsiveness, possibly there must be some gaffes that I made when declaring the default sizes to enter the media queries, don't mind, I'm evolving this, lol.
